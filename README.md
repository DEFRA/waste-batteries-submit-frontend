## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd waste-batteries-submit-frontend
nvm use
```

## Server-side Caching

We use Catbox for server-side caching. By default the service will use CatboxRedis when deployed and CatboxMemory for
local development.
You can override the default behaviour by setting the `SESSION_CACHE_ENGINE` environment variable to either `redis` or
`memory`.

Please note: CatboxMemory (`memory`) is _not_ suitable for production use! The cache will not be shared between each
instance of the service and it will not persist between restarts.

## Redis

Redis is an in-memory key-value store. Every instance of a service has access to the same Redis key-value store similar
to how services might have a database (or MongoDB). All frontend services are given access to a namespaced prefixed that
matches the service name. e.g. `my-service` will have access to everything in Redis that is prefixed with `my-service`.

If your service does not require a session cache to be shared between instances or if you don't require Redis, you can
disable setting `SESSION_CACHE_ENGINE=false` or changing the default value in `src/config/index.js`.

## Proxy

We are using forward-proxy which is set up by default. To make use of this: `import { fetch } from 'undici'` then
because of the `setGlobalDispatcher(new ProxyAgent(proxyUrl))` calls will use the ProxyAgent Dispatcher

If you are not using Wreck, Axios or Undici or a similar http that uses `Request`. Then you may have to provide the
proxy dispatcher:

To add the dispatcher to your own client:

```javascript
import { ProxyAgent } from 'undici'

return await fetch(url, {
  dispatcher: new ProxyAgent({
    uri: proxyUrl,
    keepAliveTimeout: 10,
    keepAliveMaxTimeout: 10
  })
})
```

## Local Development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Git hooks

Install git hooks (optional)

```bash
npm run git:hooks
```

### Development

To run everything in docker, you can use:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To run the application in development mode without docker, you will need to have the following services running locally:

The app authenticates with Defra ID and fetches its OIDC configuration at
startup, so start the local [Defra ID stub](#defra-id-authentication) first:

```bash
docker compose up -d cdp-defra-id-stub
```

Then run the application in `development` mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Defra ID (authentication)

This service signs users in with Defra ID (see [specs/defra-id.md](specs/defra-id.md)).
Locally it uses the [cdp-defra-id-stub](https://github.com/DEFRA/cdp-defra-id-stub),
which `docker compose up -d cdp-defra-id-stub` starts on port `3200` along with
its dependencies (Redis and DynamoDB via floci). All `defraId` config defaults
point at the stub — no environment setup needed.

Create a test user either through the stub's UI (you are redirected there on
sign-in) or via its API:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
  -d '{
    "userId": "86a7607c-a1e7-41e5-a0b6-a41680d05a2a",
    "email": "jo.bloggs@example.com",
    "firstName": "Jo",
    "lastName": "Bloggs",
    "loa": "1",
    "aal": "1",
    "enrolmentCount": 1,
    "enrolmentRequestCount": 1,
    "relationships": [
      {
        "organisationName": "Acme Waste Ltd",
        "relationshipRole": "Employee",
        "roleName": "user",
        "roleStatus": "3"
      }
    ]
  }' \
  http://localhost:3200/cdp-defra-id-stub/API/register
```

To test token refresh without waiting for expiry, force it:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3200/cdp-defra-id-stub/API/register/86a7607c-a1e7-41e5-a0b6-a41680d05a2a/expire
```

After auth changes, run the end-to-end journeys — they cover sign-in, redirect
preservation, route protection, sign-out, the failure pages, token refresh,
session storage, organisation switching and the absolute session cap, against
the real stub:

```bash
docker compose up -d cdp-defra-id-stub
npm run test:e2e
```

See [e2e/README.md](e2e/README.md) for what each journey covers and how the
suite is put together.

In deployed environments the identity provider is set per environment:
the CDP-hosted stub in `dev`, real Defra ID in `test`, `perf-test` and `prod` —
via the `DEFRA_ID_*` environment variables and CDP service secrets.

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json)
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

### Update dependencies

To update dependencies use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates):

> The following script is a good start. Check out all the options on
> the [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates)

```bash
ncu --interactive --format group
```

### Formatting

#### Windows prettier issue

If you are having issues with formatting of line breaks on Windows update your global git config by running:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

## Docker

### Development image

> [!TIP]
> For Apple Silicon users, you may need to add `--platform linux/amd64` to the `docker run` command to ensure
> compatibility fEx: `docker build --platform=linux/arm64 --no-cache --tag waste-batteries-submit-frontend`

Build:

```bash
docker build --target development --no-cache --tag waste-batteries-submit-frontend:development .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 waste-batteries-submit-frontend:development
```

### Production image

Build:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --tag waste-batteries-submit-frontend .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 waste-batteries-submit-frontend
```

### Docker Compose

A local environment with:

- Floci (replacing Localstack) for AWS services (S3, SQS)
- Redis
- MongoDB
- This service.
- A commented out backend example.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Dependabot

We have added an example dependabot configuration file to the repository. You can enable it by renaming
the [.github/example.dependabot.yml](.github/example.dependabot.yml) to `.github/dependabot.yml`

### SonarCloud

Code quality and coverage are analysed by
[SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=DEFRA_waste-batteries-submit-frontend)
on every pull request and on every publish. The quality gate appears as a check
on the pull request; the badges at the top of this file track `main`.

What is analysed is set in [sonar-project.properties](./sonar-project.properties)
— `src/` is the production code, and the unit tests, the Playwright journeys and
[test-helpers/](./test-helpers) are all declared as test code. Coverage comes
from the `./coverage/lcov.info` that `npm test` writes, so the scan runs after
the tests in each workflow.

To run the same scan locally:

```bash
SONAR_TOKEN=your-token ./sonarCloudLocal.sh
```

The script runs `npm test`, uploads the analysis with `@sonar/scan`, then writes
unresolved issues to `sonar-issues.json` and, when `python3` is available, a
copy/paste friendly `sonar-issues.md`.

To match the SonarCloud pull request summary view, pass the pull request key:

```bash
SONAR_TOKEN=your-token SONAR_PULL_REQUEST=6 ./sonarCloudLocal.sh
```
